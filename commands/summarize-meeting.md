# Summarize Meeting

Read the meeting transcription provided by the user (file path or pasted text via "$ARGUMENTS"), then use the **summarize-meeting** skill to produce a structured summary in the original language of the meeting and save it to a file in the format the user requested (docx, pdf, pptx, etc.).

If the user did not specify a format, ask which format they prefer.
